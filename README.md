# Automated E-Card for High School
These are simple Python scripts for producing high school report cards.

## Installation
1. Make sure that Python 3 is installed in your system. The simplest way to test for a Python installation on your Windows PC is to open a command prompt. Once a command prompt window opens, type `python` and press Enter. Python is not installed if you receive a message like
```
Python is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
```
For Windows users, click [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) to install the correct version for your PC.
2. Check whether pip is installed in your system. Type in the following command at the command prompt: 
```
pip help
```
If PIP responds, then PIP is installed. Otherwise, there will be an error saying the program could not be found. To install PIP,

## Usage
1. Edit the information and grades in the *ecard-infos.xlsx* file.
2. If you want to produce cards for the first grading period, run** the *ecardFirst2021.py* script. For the second grading period, run the *ecardSecond2021.py* script. Follow [this tutorial](https://techendo.com/post/how-to-run-a-python-script.html) to learn how to run python scripts on Windows.

*Note: To open a windows command prompt, press the “Windows Key+R” to open a “Run” dialog box. Next, type in “cmd”, and then click “OK”. This opens a normal Command Prompt.

**Note: During the first run, the script will install various Python packages so it may take several minutes to one hour depending on your internet connection. Please be patient.
